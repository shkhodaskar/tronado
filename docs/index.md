# Welcome to TRONado

##### A brief introduction: The History of Tron

Tron is a popular arcade game that is still played by many today. While Tron may seem like a purely skill based game, don't be fooled! The game consists of four players piloting a vehicle. The goal is to stay alive the longest, by not crashing into the walls or other player's trails. The longer a player survives, the longer their motorcycle trail increases. This creates an interesting dynamic because the amount of available moves quickly diminishes. Players have to think quick in order to avoid crashing into their own trail or other players' trails. Good players are quick to navigate and avoid collisions; however, great players come up with strategies to minimize the amount of moves available for other players or simply remain dormant--avoiding their ultimate demise!
